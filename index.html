    <h2>About Nile River and its Country.</h2>
    </div>

    <p>Unlike other large rivers, the Nile flows from the south northward and floods at the warmest time of the year.The river consists of two main tributaries known as the White Nile and the Blue Nile. These rivers meet at the Sudanese capital, Khartoum. From there, the unified river is joined by the Atbarah River before reaching Egypt in the north.</p>
    <p>For centuries, the Nile was a symbol for the development of civilization. The ancient Egyptians settled along the river valley and the eastern delta, in the north of Aswan, and made it into a prosperous and fertile region.</p>
    <p>Over the past 50 years, six Nile basin countries have built 25 dams and used them for hydroelectric power and irrigation. The most unfortunate Ethiopia contributes more than 85% of water to the Nile and does not benefit from it; instead negatively impacted by the Nile due to the blue Nile flood eroding a vast amount of fertile soil from the highland and carrying it to the desert of Egypt downstream as silt, turning the water dark brown. On April 2, 2011 The people and Government of Ethiopia start construction of Grand Ethiopia Renaissance dam to Enhanced opportunities for economic integration and Improved electric energy.</p>

  <ul>
  <li>The Nile River’s average discharge is about 300 million cubic meters (10.5 billion cubic feet) per day.</li>
  <li>The length of the Nile River is approximately 6,850 kilometers (4,256 miles).</li>
  <li>unlike other great rivers known to them—flowed from the south northward and was in flood at the warmest time of the year was an unsolved mystery to the ancient Egyptians and Greeks.</li>

  <li>If you see on this map the only river is flowing through the Sahara Desert is the Nile River, the largest, driest desert on the face of the Earth. Egyptian must be very lucky for the river to make this great bend in Sudan, otherwise, it would flow straight to the Mediterranean Sea." Instead, it bends in Sudan southwestward and wanders through the Sahara for another 320 kilometers (200 miles) before resuming its northward course.</li>

<h2>How do the country benefit from the Nile River?</h2>
</div>

<p>Today, the river serves as a source of irrigation, electric power, essential transportation, trade route, and the art and science of cultivating land to grow crops (farming) or raise livestock (ranching). But the whole Nile river country benefits from the Nile? If you see, Ethiopia supplies more than 85% of the Nile's water. Despite this, Ethiopia uses far less water than its neighbors. Egypt and Sudan have historically used the vast majority of the Nile's water. They point to agreements from 1929 and 1959, which gave them unfair over projects along the Nile, privileges that Ethiopia and other Nile adjacent nations have been rejecting as they seek to develop their hydroelectric projects on the river. The Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam (GERD) is a hydropower dam that will increase Ethiopian Hydroelectric power generation by 15,692 GWh/year. GERD is under construction and brings ample light to society.<p>Three countries' populations (Egypt, Sudan, and Ethiopia) access electricity.</p>

		<p>The Blue Nile originates in Ethiopia and supplies more than 85% of the Nile’s water. Despite this, Ethiopia uses far less water than its neighbors. Egypt and Sudan have historically used the vast majority of the Nile’s water. They point to agreements from 1929 and 1959 which gave them privileges over projects along the Nile, privileges that Ethiopia and other Nile adjacent nations have been rejecting as they seek to develop their own hydroelectric projects on the river.
